###### Guidelines

- [x]  Build a single page appUse react and redux
- [x]  Use Shipwell API to validate address input
- [x]  Use Google Maps for drawing markers and routes on the map
- [x]  Create a repository on GitHub and share the link with us. (if the repo is private share with 'nfortenberry')

###### Bonus

- [ ] Show the user's company address on the map. This information is returned in the user information request.
- [ ] Write tests for your code
